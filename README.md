BJCP Style Data
===============
While the [BJCP website](http://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php) contains a wealth
of beer style information, none of the provided files are conducive to
data processing. The goal of this project is to provide the official BJCP style
guidelines in multiple data formats which can be easily used in software
applications.

Usage
